# University Advisor Appointment System

This web-based system improves the traditional process of booking appointments between students and academic advisors, which is often inefficient and confusing. Students can register, browse advisors by courses, and book appointments in real time. Advisors get a centralized dashboard to manage their appointments easily.

Key features include secure registration/login, user dashboards, and real-time scheduling. This system focuses solely on academic advising appointments and does not cover other academic functions like grading or course registration.
